Obtain the 3D path of the dolphin
----------------------------------

1. Record 2 sychronized videos of a dolphin swimming on a pool.
2. Create an OBJ file representing the real world scenario with the `py3dscene-editor <https://bitbucket.org/UmSenhorQualquer/py3dsceneeditor>`_  application.
3. Execute the application d-tracker-singlecam for each of the cameras to extract the dolphin centroid.
4. Use the `pythonvideoannotator application (v1.5) <https://github.com/UmSenhorQualquer/pythonVideoAnnotator/>`_ to correct any error of the tracking.
5. Execute the application d-tracker-smoothpath to combine the cameras information and reconstruct the 3D path of the Dolphin.
