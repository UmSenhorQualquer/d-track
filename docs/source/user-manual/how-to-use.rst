Obtain the 3D path of the dolphin
----------------------------------

1. Record 2 sychronized videos of a dolphin swimming on a pool.
2. Create an OBJ file representing the real world scenario with the `py3dscene-editor <https://bitbucket.org/UmSenhorQualquer/py3dsceneeditor>`_  application.
3. Execute the application d-tracker-singlecam for each of the cameras to extract the dolphin centroid.
4. Use the `pythonvideoannotator application <https://github.com/UmSenhorQualquer/pythonVideoAnnotator/>`_ to correct any error in the tracking.
5. Execute the application d-tracker-smoothpath to combine the cameras information and reconstruct the 3D path of the Dolphin.

d-tracker-singlecam
___________________________

This application is used to segment the images of each camera and find the dolphin in the pool.
Select the threshold values for each color channel. Try to paint only the dolphin with much colors you can.
